                    <p className="text-blue-800">
                      If you&apos;re questioning whether your feelings are normal, that&apos;s already a good reason to talk to a healthcare provider. Postpartum depression is treatable, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <h2>The Gray Area of New Parent Mental Health</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    You&apos;re running on 3 hours of sleep, haven&apos;t showered in days, and feel like you&apos;re barely keeping your head above water. But is this just normal new parent exhaustion, or could it be something more serious like postpartum depression?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This distinction matters because while exhaustion is temporary and improves with rest and support, postpartum depression requires professional treatment to resolve. Understanding the difference can help you get the right kind of help.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Understanding the Spectrum</h2>

                  <h3>Baby Blues (Days 3-14)</h3>
                  <p>
                    Up to 80% of new parents experience &quot;baby blues&quot; - mood swings, crying spells, anxiety, and difficulty sleeping that typically peaks around day 5 and resolves within two weeks.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Normal New Parent Exhaustion</h3>
                  <p>
                    This is the expected tiredness from disrupted sleep, life changes, and learning to care for a baby. You might feel overwhelmed but still experience moments of joy and connection with your baby.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Postpartum Depression</h3>
                  <p>
                    A serious mood disorder that affects 1 in 8 new parents. It involves persistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that interfere with daily functioning and don&apos;t improve with rest.
                  </p>

                      <strong>Baby blues:</strong> Start within days of birth, peak around day 5, resolve by 2 weeks<br/>
                      <strong>Postpartum depression:</strong> Can start anytime in the first year, often 2-8 weeks postpartum, persists without treatment

                  <p>
                    Ask yourself: &quot;Am I able to be a good enough parent most of the time?&quot; If exhaustion is your main issue, you&apos;ll likely answer yes - you&apos;re tired but managing. If postpartum depression is present, you might feel like you&apos;re failing your baby or that they&apos;d be better off without you.

                  <h2>When and How to Seek Help</h2>

                  <h3>Don&apos;t Wait for It to Get Worse</h3>

                  <h2>Supporting Your Recovery</h2>

                  <h3>Be Patient with Yourself</h3>
                  <p>
                    Recovery from postpartum depression takes time. Some people feel better within weeks, while others need several months of treatment. This doesn&apos;t reflect your strength or worthiness as a parent.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Build Your Support Network</h3>
                  <p>
                    Identify trusted family members, friends, or professionals who can provide practical and emotional support. Don&apos;t try to handle everything alone.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Focus on Small Steps</h3>
                  <p>
                    Set realistic daily goals. Some days, success might just be taking a shower, eating a meal, or spending a few minutes outside.
                  </p>
