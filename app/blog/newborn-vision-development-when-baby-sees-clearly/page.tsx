                    <p className="text-blue-800">
                      Newborns can only see clearly 8-12 inches away (perfect for seeing your face during feeding). Full adult-level vision doesn&apos;t develop until around 8 months to 2 years.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <h2>What Your Newborn Sees at Birth</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    Your newborn enters the world with very limited vision. While not technically blind, their visual world is dramatically different from yours. Understanding these limitations helps set realistic expectations and shows why certain behaviors (like not making eye contact immediately) are completely normal.
                  </p>

                  <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">

                    <ul className="text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Distance:</strong> Clear vision only 8-12 inches away</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Focus:</strong> Everything beyond 12 inches is very blurry</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Colors:</strong> Mostly black, white, and gray tones</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Contrast:</strong> High contrast patterns are easiest to see</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Movement:</strong> Can detect motion but not track smoothly</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Depth perception:</strong> None - the world appears flat</li>
                    </ul>

                  <h2>Month-by-Month Vision Development Timeline</h2>

                  <h3>Birth to 1 Month: Learning to Focus</h3>
                  <div className="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-purple-800 mb-3">What&apos;s Happening:</h4>
                    <ul className="text-purple-700 space-y-1">
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Eyes may appear crossed or wandering (normal)</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Pupils react to light but slowly</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Prefers faces and high-contrast patterns</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ May briefly track large, slow-moving objects</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Blinking reflex is present but minimal</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h3>1-2 Months: First Real Eye Contact</h3>
                  <p>
                    This is when the magic happens! Around 6-8 weeks, your baby will start making deliberate eye contact. Their eyes should start working together more consistently, though occasional crossing is still normal.
                  </p>

                  <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">‚ú® Milestones to Watch For:</h4>
                    <ul className="text-green-700 space-y-1">
                      <li>‚Ä¢ First sustained eye contact (6-8 weeks)</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Following faces as they move</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Beginning to focus on objects 12-18 inches away</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Showing preference for human faces over objects</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ May start to smile in response to your face</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h3>2-4 Months: Color Vision Emerges</h3>
                  <p>
                    Your baby&apos;s world becomes more colorful! They can now see red and green, and by 4 months, their color vision is nearly complete. This is also when depth perception begins to develop.
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color development:</strong> Red and green first, then blue and yellow</li>
                    <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Can follow moving objects smoothly</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand-eye coordination:</strong> Beginning to reach for what they see</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance vision:</strong> Can see across the room, though still blurry</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>4-6 Months: Depth Perception Develops</h3>
                  <p>
                    This is a huge leap in visual development. Your baby can now judge distances and see the world in three dimensions. They&apos;ll become fascinated with small objects and their own hands.
                  </p>

                  <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-3">üîç New Visual Skills:</h4>
                    <ul className="text-yellow-700 space-y-1">
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Depth perception allows reaching accurately</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Can see small objects clearly</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Recognizes familiar faces across the room</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Shows interest in mirror reflections</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Can distinguish between similar colors</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h3>6-8 Months: Fine Visual Motor Skills</h3>
                  <p>
                    Vision is now good enough for precise hand-eye coordination. Your baby can see small objects like Cheerios and will try to pick them up. They&apos;re also developing object permanence - understanding that things exist even when out of sight.
                  </p>

                  <h3>8-12 Months: Near Adult-Level Vision</h3>
                  <p>
                    By their first birthday, your baby&apos;s vision is approaching adult levels. They can see clearly at various distances, have full color vision, and excellent depth perception.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Supporting Your Baby&apos;s Visual Development</h2>

                  <h3>0-3 Months: High Contrast Is Key</h3>

                    <li><strong>Adequate lighting:</strong> Bright but not harsh light helps development</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>3-6 Months: Introduce Color and Movement</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Colorful toys:</strong> Especially red, green, and high-contrast colors</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobiles:</strong> Slowly moving objects to track</li>

                  <h2>Common Vision Concerns for New Parents</h2>

                  <h3>&ldquo;My Baby&apos;s Eyes Look Crossed&rdquo;</h3>
                  <p>
                    Occasional eye crossing is normal until 4-6 months. Newborn eye muscles are still learning to work together. However, if one or both eyes consistently turn in or out after 4 months, consult your pediatrician.
                  </p>

                  <h3>&ldquo;My Baby Doesn&apos;t Make Eye Contact&rdquo;</h3>
                  <p>
                    Eye contact typically develops around 6-8 weeks. Before this, babies may look near your face but not directly at your eyes. This is normal visual development, not a social concern.
                  </p>

                  <h3>&ldquo;One Eye Seems Different&rdquo;</h3>
                  <p>
                    If you notice one eye consistently looks different (turns in/out, appears cloudy, or pupils look different), contact your pediatrician. Early intervention for vision problems is crucial.
                  </p>

                  <h2>The Role of Light in Vision Development</h2>

                  <p>
                    Appropriate light exposure is crucial for healthy vision development. Natural light helps regulate circadian rhythms and supports proper eye development, while avoiding harsh artificial lights protects developing retinas.
                  </p>

                  <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-blue-800 mb-3">üí° Light Guidelines:</h4>
                    <ul className="text-blue-700 space-y-2">
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Provide plenty of natural light during the day</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Avoid pointing bright lights directly at baby&apos;s eyes</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Use soft, warm lighting for nighttime care</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Limit screen exposure (not recommended under 18 months)</li>
                      <li>‚Ä¢ Protect eyes from direct sunlight when outdoors</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <h2>Vision and Overall Development</h2>

                  <p>
                    Vision development is closely linked to cognitive, motor, and social development. As your baby&apos;s sight improves, you&apos;ll notice advances in reaching, grasping, social smiling, and overall engagement with the world.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How Vision Supports Other Development:</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Motor skills:</strong> Better vision enables more accurate reaching and grasping</li>
                    <li><strong>Social development:</strong> Eye contact and facial recognition support bonding</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive growth:</strong> Visual exploration drives learning about objects and space</li>
                    <li><strong>Language development:</strong> Watching mouths and facial expressions aids communication</li>
                  </ul>
