                    <p className="text-blue-800">
                      Most newborns need to feed every 2-3 hours (8-12 times per day). Both on-demand and scheduled feeding can work - choose what feels right for your family. Watch for hunger cues and wet diapers as signs your baby is getting enough.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <h2>The Great Feeding Debate: On-Demand vs Scheduled</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    Walk into any parenting forum, and you&apos;ll find heated debates about newborn feeding schedules. Some parents swear by feeding on-demand (responsive feeding), while others prefer structured schedules. The truth? Both approaches can work beautifully - it&apos;s about finding what suits your baby and family.
                  </p>

                  <h3>On-Demand Feeding: The Natural Approach</h3>
                  
                  <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Following your baby&apos;s hunger cues and feeding whenever they show signs of wanting to eat.
                  </p>

                  <div className="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-green-800 mb-3">Hunger Cues to Watch For:</h4>
                    <ul className="text-green-700 space-y-1">
                      <li>â€¢ Rooting (turning head and opening mouth when cheek is touched)</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Sucking motions or sounds</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Hand-to-mouth movements</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Smacking lips</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Increased alertness and activity</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Fussiness (crying is a late hunger cue)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Helps establish milk supply, reduces stress for both baby and parent, and naturally adjusts to your baby&apos;s changing needs.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Challenges:</strong> Can feel unpredictable, especially in the early weeks when babies may want to cluster feed.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Scheduled Feeding: The Structured Approach</h3>
                  
                  <p>
                    <strong>What it is:</strong> Feeding your baby at set intervals, typically every 2-3 hours.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Benefits:</strong> Provides predictability, can help with planning, and some parents find it reduces anxiety about whether baby is eating enough.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Challenges:</strong> May not always align with baby&apos;s natural rhythms, and rigid schedules can interfere with milk supply establishment in breastfeeding.
                  </p>

                    <h4 className="font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-3">ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: The Hybrid Approach</h4>
                    <p className="text-yellow-700">
                      Many successful parents use a flexible schedule - aiming for feeds every 2-3 hours but watching for hunger cues in between. This gives structure while remaining responsive to baby&apos;s needs.
                    </p>
                  </div>

                  <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                  <div className="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
                    <ul className="text-blue-700 space-y-2">
                      <li>â€¢ Both on-demand and scheduled feeding can work - choose what fits your family</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Newborns typically need 8-12 feeds per day in the early weeks</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Watch for hunger cues rather than just the clock</li>
                      <li>â€¢ It&apos;s hard to overfeed a breastfed baby; formula babies need portion awareness</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Wet diapers and weight gain are better indicators than feeding frequency</li>
                      <li>â€¢ Trust your instincts, but don&apos;t hesitate to seek professional help</li>
                    </ul>
